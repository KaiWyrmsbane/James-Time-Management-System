# James Time Management System

## An example of a non-convoluted way for employees to keep track of their hours worked, PTO time left, and personal settings on account.

This project shows one of the ways a time management system could work. How to build the logic behind that system
using the C# programming language. In this system an employee will be able to:

* clock-in and out and receive the number of hours worked when clocked-out. On the same 
page the user will be able to see the number of PTO hours they have and the renewal date of their PTO.
* Decide to take time off on specific days whether it be Vacation, Sick, or emergency time while seeing PTO renewal date.
* Edit account settings such as name and email address
